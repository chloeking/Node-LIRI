... It's a shame I have to have twenty tweets considering I have nothing to actually post
I recently made a volunteering website with three other group members, I had to work with the google maps APIS
I have also made a pokemon hangman, using javascript
----------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
Well the instructions for my assignment were to create some tweets for node to read about my most recent projects
Why do people even use twitter?
